# Example workflows

Eight complete, runnable workflow scripts. Each is a real, lint-clean file — find
the closest match to what you are building, read it, then adapt it. All eight pass
`scripts/validate-workflow.mjs`.

| File | Topology | Demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| `review-branch.js` | pipeline + nested `parallel` | structured `schema` on every stage, a Haiku verify stage, `phase` set inside stages |
| `implement-and-review.js` | `do/while` loop | a round cap, a `schema` with a `passed` boolean that drives the loop, `args` used as a plain task string |
| `planning-card-triage.js` | list → pipeline | reading `args` fields directly, a priority-rank `.filter()` + early `return`, an `assay` tool call inside an agent |
| `dead-code-sweep.js` | loop-until-dry | a dry-streak counter, a hard `MAX_ROUNDS` cap, parallel removal under `isolation: 'worktree'` that self-reverts |
| `api-contract-drift-detector.js` | fan-out with a barrier | a deliberate `parallel()` barrier, an optional `args.types` seed that skips discovery, `model: 'haiku'` on the fan-out |
| `geometry-parity-audit.js` | parallel → barrier | a barrier because clustering divergences needs the whole set, a Haiku compare stage, an optional `args.ops` seed that skips the discovery agent |
| `route-and-refactor.js` | routing (dispatch table) | a classifier discriminant, a `ROUTES` table, an unroutable file → `null` → `.filter(Boolean)`, `model: 'haiku'` on the mechanical SQL row, a terminal synthesis stage |
| `rebuild-and-reconcile.js` | fan-out → reconcile (cluster → fix → verify) | deferring cross-file work as DATA (a file LIST), union-find clustering by shared file, a separate per-claim adversarial verifier, a count-barrier early-exit |

## What to copy from them

**Setting a model.** `review-branch.js`, `api-contract-drift-detector.js`, and
`geometry-parity-audit.js` push a whole cheap, mechanical fan-out to `model: 'haiku'`
and mirror it on the matching `meta.phases[]` entry — that entry is only a *label*
for the permission dialog, while the `model` on the `agent()` call is what actually
runs, so set both or the dialog lies. `route-and-refactor.js` tiers per *row* instead
of per phase: only the mechanical SQL `ROUTES` row carries `model: 'haiku'` (the
judgement-heavy rows omit `model` and inherit the session model), so its one
`agent()` call reads `model: route.model` and its phase entry has no `model` —
a phase that mixes models cannot carry one label.

**Tiering reasoning (`effort`), not the model.** `effort` is the orthogonal axis —
it tiers how hard the agent reasons, independent of which model runs.
`review-branch.js` drops the verify stage to `model: 'haiku'` yet keeps
`effort: 'high'`, so a cheap model still reasons hard on the adversarial refute;
`planning-card-triage.js` runs the mechanical card-pull at `effort: 'low'` and the
adversarial completeness check at `effort: 'high'`; `dead-code-sweep.js` runs its
finder at `effort: 'low'`. Reach for `effort` to dial reasoning per stage without
moving off the session model, and combine it with `model` when a stage is both
cheap *and* needs to think.

**Structured output (`schema`).** Every example that later reads a field off a
result defines a JSON Schema `const` and passes it as `schema` — so `agent()`
returns a parsed object and the next line is plain JavaScript (`review.passed`,
`issues.filter(...)`). Schemas are kept small and `required`-tight.

**Reading `args`.** `args` arrives as structured data — read it directly.
`planning-card-triage.js` reads object fields with a literal default
(`args?.minPriority ?? 'high'`); `api-contract-drift-detector.js` and
`geometry-parity-audit.js` take an optional array field that *overrides* a discovery
step (`Array.isArray(args?.types) ? args.types : null`, then enumerate when null);
`route-and-refactor.js` takes a top-level array with a default list
(`Array.isArray(args) && args.length ? args : [...]`); `implement-and-review.js`
takes a plain-text task string. None of them parse `args` — there is nothing to parse.

**A hard stop on every loop.** `implement-and-review.js` (`MAX_ROUNDS`) and
`dead-code-sweep.js` (`DRY_STREAK` + `MAX_ROUNDS`) — open-ended loops always need
a counter or a budget guard.

**`pipeline` vs `parallel`.** `review-branch.js` and `planning-card-triage.js` use
`pipeline` (no barrier — each item advances on its own).
`api-contract-drift-detector.js` and `geometry-parity-audit.js` use `parallel` as a
*deliberate* barrier — and each says in a comment why the whole result set is
genuinely needed at once.

**Routing (a dispatch table).** `route-and-refactor.js` is fan-out with a `ROUTES`
table threaded into the thunk: a plain-JS classifier maps each item to a route key,
the `ROUTES` row supplies the specialist prompt (and its `model`), and an item that
matches no row returns `null` and falls out at `.filter(Boolean)`. Copy it when one
loop must hand different items to different specialists — never grow a `Get`/`GetBy`
family of near-identical entrypoints when one discriminant + one table will do.

## Running one

```js
Workflow({ scriptPath: '<skill-dir>/assets/examples/review-branch.js' })
```

Or copy the file into `.claude/workflows/` and invoke it by its `meta.name`:

```js
Workflow({ name: 'review-branch' })
```

Examples that take input are invoked with `args` — see the header comment in
each file for the exact shape, e.g.:

```js
Workflow({ name: 'planning-card-triage', args: { scope: 'libs/csharp/Rasm.Bim', minPriority: 'high' } })
```
